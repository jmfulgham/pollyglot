for this project here.

### To Run
Just pull the code! The app is built in pure HTML, CSS, and JS, so your IDE should be able to open your html page in your chosen browser.
The [Cloudflare worker](https://mo-openai-api-worker.oa-api-worker.workers.dev/) will handle all calls to OpenAI, so it makes
it simple to play around with the code! Have fun :)
